Photography Portfolio

Built using HTML and CSS, this site was created based on a design in Figma. I added responisve elements to enhance the given design, such as hover styling. 

I used the idea of atomic design to break the site in to smaller peices to create a pattern library. Once this was complete I could build up a page in a few minutes.

I also used BEM methodology to create scalable and maintainable stylesheets. No conflicting styling, hooray!
